## MINI PROJECT

## 🏠HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION 🏠
  Welcome to the HOUSE PRICE PRIDECTION PROJECT! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and more.
  Whether you're a real estate enthusiast, a data science beginner, or an experienced developer, this project offers valuable insights into predictive modeling and real-world applications.

  ## 🌟 WHY THIS PROJECT?
  
  Predicting house prices is a classic yet challenging problem in the real estate industry. Accurate price predictions can help:
  Homebuyers make informed decisions.

 Sellers set competitive prices.

 Real Estate Agents optimize property listings.

 Investors identify profitable opportunities.

 This project leverages machine learning to provide accurate and reliable house price predictions, making it a valuable tool for anyone involved in the real estate market.

 ## 📊 DATASET
    
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about houses, including:

Numerical Features: Square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc.

Categorical Features: Location, neighborhood, property type, etc.

Target Variable: House price.

rce: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle

## 🛠️ APPROCH

Here’s how we tackled the problem:

# Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers.

Encoded categorical variables.

Scaled numerical features for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data distributions, correlations, and trends.

Identified key features influencing house prices.

# Feature Engineering:

Created new features (e.g., price per square foot).

Selected the most relevant features using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance.

# Model Selection:

Tested multiple machine learning algorithms, including:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R² Score.

## 🚀 KEY FEATURES

Accurate Predictions: Achieved an R² score of 0.92 (or your actual score) on the test dataset.

User-Friendly: Easy-to-use code and well-documented steps.

Scalable: The model can be extended to include additional features or datasets.

Visualizations: Interactive plots and graphs to understand data trends.

## 📈 RESULT

R² Score: 0.92

RMSE: $25,000

MAE: $18,000

Key Insights:

Location and square footage are the most significant factors influencing house prices.

Houses with modern amenities tend to have higher prices.
